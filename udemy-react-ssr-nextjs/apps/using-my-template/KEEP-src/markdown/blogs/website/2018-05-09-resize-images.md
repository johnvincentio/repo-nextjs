This article suggests a procedure for resizing images for use on the web.

<!-- end -->

## Mac Screen Snapshot

* Full screen: Command Shift 3
* Partial screen: Command Shift 4

Save `.png` file to desktop.

## Handle the Image

* Start Photoshop Elements
* Open Image

* File, Save As
	* PNG Options
		* Compression: Smallest/ Slow
		* Interlace: None

This may be a large image suitable for demonstration purposes. Also useful for my blog.

## Crop Image

It may be necessary to crop the image.

Image, Crop

Use the crop icon (left menu) to crop a piece of the image.

There is so much that can be done but this is beyond the scope of this document.

## Resize Images for the Web

Image, Resize, Image Size

* Pixel dimensions
	* Width: 360 pixels
	* Height: 300 pixels

Try with constrain proportions to get a idea as to how suited is this image for the proportions required.

If the image is not properly suited, it is best to remake the image.

Save image if required

#### Save for the Web

* File, Save for the Web
* Change size and colors.

Get image size to `< 200kb`

Save as a `gif`

## To Square an Image

Start Adobe Photoshop Elements Editor

Drag the `jpg` file into the app.

To resize the canvas, for example:

* Image, Resize, Canvas Size
* Width: 160 pixels
* Height: 160 pixels
* Canvas extension color:
	* Choose: `#937161` as this will stand out.

The image is resized, now let's improve the background.

* Select Color Picker Tool
	* Click on a background pixel of the desired color.

* Select Paint Bucket Tool
	* Click on the background that needs to be changed.

The background color should now be uniform. However, if not:

* Select Color Picker Tool
	* Click on a background pixel of the desired color.

* Select Brush Tool
	* Brush as desired.

To resize the image:

* Image, Resize, Image Size
* Width: 260 pixels
