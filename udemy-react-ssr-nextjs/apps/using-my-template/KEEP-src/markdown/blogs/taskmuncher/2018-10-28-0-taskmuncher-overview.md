## Technical

* [TaskMuncher](https://www.taskmuncher.com) is a [Progressive Web App (PWA)](/blog/#Pwa)

* [TaskMuncher](https://www.taskmuncher.com) is built using the MERN stack. The front-end is built using [React](/blog/#React), [Material-UI](/blog/#Material-UI), [Redux](/blog/#Redux), [HTML5](/blog/#Html), [Sass](/blog/#Sass) and [CSS3](/blog/#Css), the server-side using [Node](/blog/#Node) with [Express](/blog/#Express) as the web server and [Mongo](/blog/#Mongo) as the database.

* [TaskMuncher](https://www.taskmuncher.com) is fully responsive, adapting for mobile, table and desktop viewports.

* Extensive form validation and error handling is demonstrated throughout the app. On the front-end, field type, value, length etc is validated using [HTML5](/blog/#Html), [React](/blog/#React) and [Redux](/blog/#Redux). On the server-side, [JOI](/blog/#Joi) performs detailed validation and a [Mongoose](/blog/#Mongoose) schema provides further error checking for field values and uniqueness.

* Server-side email functionality is provided by a [Nodemailer OAuth 2.0 implementation](/blog/#Nodemailer), using [Google Gmail](/node/express-emails-gmail/)

* An extensive API has been built to provide database access to the [TaskMuncher App](https://www.taskmuncher.com) using [Express](/blog/#Express), with 27 separate endpoints constructed.

* [TaskMuncher](https://www.taskmuncher.com) is fully unit tested on the front and server-side. For [React](/blog/#React) testing, Jest has been used. For the server-side, [Mocha](/blog/#Mocha) and [Chai](/blog/#Chai), with extensive use of the [Faker](/blog/#Faker) library to mock-out dependencies.

### Testing Deployment

For a simple application deployed from a single Github repository:

* [Heroku](/blog/#Heroku)
* [TravisCI](/blog/#Travis)
* [Mongo](/blog/#Mongo)

[TaskMuncher](https://www.taskmuncher.com) has multiple Github repositories and thus is not suitable for Heroku. The testing deployment is another droplet at [Digital Ocean](/blog/#Digital_Ocean), in effect a duplicate of the actual production environment.

### Descope

A list of user stories to be supported in the MVP:

* list tasks
* add a goal
* add a project

Other requirements:

* Fast (page speed score)
* Responsive

### User Screens

### User Journey for Each Screen

For each screen, specify the way(s) the user journeys through the page. Use **User Flows**

A user flow describes:

* what the user sees
* what they do
* what they see next after doing that thing

#### User Journey - Screen for add, edit, delete a task

User has a list of articles.
User selects an article
User is presented with the article.

User Journey - Screen for selecting a news channel
User requests a list of news channel.
User requests a news channel.
User sees latest news from that channel

User Journey - Screen for adding a news channel
User requests a list of news channels.
User adds news channel.
If error, show error.
Else, add news channel.
Add news channel to list of news channels.

User Journey - Screen for adding news channel to my channels

### Project Requirements

Server must

* use Node/Express
* use a db
* have RESTful API and/or `Socket.io` layer
* serve static assets
* have comprehensive testing
* have high code quality. Among other things that means
	* choosing good variable names
	* writing functions that have a single responsibility
	* consistently following a style guide
* well architected

Client must have

* polished UI
* responsive
* follows accessibility best practices, for instance, all inputs wrapped in forms, all inputs have labels
* bundled and optimized for delivery
* comprehensive testing
* high code quality
* well architected
* cross browser tested, with support for current version of popular browsers


### Implement MVP

* CI and Deployment. Set up continuous integration with Heroku and Travis CI right away, and have tests automatically run each time you push to GitHub
* Git and GitHub. Develop each user story with a feature branch and when ready to deploy to your production environment, do a pull request from your feature branch into master, triggering an automatic deploy from Travis CI.
* Start with mock data. Define API resources and the schema for the data they return as code up the front end.
* Both server and client side unit testing. As complete a feature or support a user story, write tests. Strive for comprehensive test coverage for both server- and client-side code. At a minimum, that means testing routes, components, actions, and reducers.

### Gather User Feedback and Iterate

Now that MVP is live, it's time to get user feedback. The sorts of things you're going to want to find out about are:

* Do my users think the app is interesting or valuable?
* Did my users use the app as I intended?
* Did my users encounter any bugs or broken features?
* Did my users understand how to use the app?
* Get feedback from real life people who are not you and your mentor. 

Then, based on what you learn, do a round of iteration on your MVP to address any issues that came up.

Note findings from user feedback. Note what, if anything, I did about it.

#### Feedback

* New user should be stepped through the process. Add a goal and a project, then add a task.

* under status, categories which are empty shouldn't be shown at all
* Would be cool that instead of clicking the 3 dots and then editing something, that default action by clicking on something is edit. This would be better user experience. Now you can't really click on anything and feels strange.
* I think that it would be better if the list view is the default one and the grid one secondary
* When I want to expand a project, I have to click on the arrow pointing down. It would be just better that this happens on clicking on the project itself.
* List view is confusing when browsing projects etc. It doesn't imply which list I'm viewing (from which project, it seams that all of them aggregated in the same list)
* Would be nice to create a task by using the calendar, by clicking on some specific date

Also on your landing page, you should probably have 3 or 4 items per row
(those things with icons and description)
aside those comments and generally some UX stuff.

Amazing job, this is a very valuable project for your CV. Also feel super fast and fluid.
