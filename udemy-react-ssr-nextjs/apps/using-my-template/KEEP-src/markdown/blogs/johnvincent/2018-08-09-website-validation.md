Edit file on server, file has 24 lines. Problem is caused by Scss files with comments at the top.

```
Remove the header comments. Verify destination/css/all.css is only one line.
```

* Browser caching
	* Browser caching not enabled for all resources
		* Not enabled for third party resources www.google-analytics.com

Could fix with Nginx Header Module. for details, see [How to Implement Browser Caching with Nginx's header Module on Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-implement-browser-caching-with-nginx-s-header-module-on-ubuntu-16-04)

```
#browser caching of static assets
    location ~*  \.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|ico|css|js)$ {

I have decided not to implement at this time.

<br/>

### Test `www.johnvincent.io/about`

Same as above.

<br/>

Same as above.

<br/>

### Test `www.johnvincent.io/resume`

Same as above.

<br/>

### Test `www.johnvincent.io/privacy-policy/`

<br/>

### Test `www.johnvincent.io/terms-of-service/`

Same as above.

<br/>

### Test `www.johnvincent.io/blog`

```
SEO: 94
```

caused by the links on the right. No real answer to this other than a redesign.

Not clear to me that anyone using a mobile device would find the list useful.

<br/>

### Test `www.johnvincent.io/johnvincent/overview/`

Same links problem as above.

Performance: 79.

This is caused by the images. They should be moved.

<br/>

### Test `www.johnvincent.io/contact`

Lower scores caused by Google Maps. Nothing to do here.

<br/>

### Test `www.johnvincent.io/johnvincent/overview/`

Performance: 69

Many images, they should be moved to `images`.

### Test `www.johnvincent.io/node/node-authentication/`

Performance: 94

Caused by `/static/slider-bg2-36383f6â€¦.jpg` being a jpg file.

Image formats like JPEG 2000, JPEG XR, and WebP often provide better compression. This is a can of worms best left alone.
