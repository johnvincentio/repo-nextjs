        "The applications were now using 20+ repeating batch jobs that were mostly run at night. The batch job application had very poor error handling and error reporting capabilities. The hardware was outmatched which caused near constant job failures. Investigating the failures and managing the tool so it eventually got the jobs done was consuming maybe 15% of my teams' effort.",
        "I designed a JEE application in 3 pieces.",
        "- Administration application to administer all jobs. Jobs could be added, updated, deleted, started or stopped by the admin application. All jobs provided messages for its own job log which was viewable from the administration application. All server logs are viewable from the application.",
        "- A job engine which is responsible for running the jobs. Jobs are run according to their own schedule. The engine was responsible for handling jobs that failed.",
        "- The jobs themselves. They are built on a standard framework so they all behave the same way.",
        "The Administration application uses JEE, Java, Struts 2, JSP, HTML, CSS, Quartz, DB2, XML.",
        "The Jobs engine uses Quartz, JEE, Web Services, DB2.",
        "The jobs themselves are implemented as Web Services with a custom interface to ensure compliance.",
        "Everything deployed to WebSphere running on Linux servers.",
        "The administration of the Job Scheduler was handed over to the Web Operations Group.",
        "Running of batch jobs became more predictable. When a job failed, a web operations person could identify the problem and restart the job.",
        "The error reporting now allowed for all errors to be reported in logs that were easy to find. It allowed for a quick diagnosis of the problem. All problems were tracked.",
        "In a short period of time, I was able to use the application and it’s error logs to prove to the business that the hardware was insufficient. This data was used as financial justification for new hardware.",
        "With the upgraded hardware the problems and the amount of team effort consumed were reduced to almost zero."
