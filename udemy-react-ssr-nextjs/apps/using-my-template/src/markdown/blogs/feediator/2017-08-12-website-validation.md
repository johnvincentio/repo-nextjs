## Check Browser Caching

For details, see [Browser Caching](/website/browser-caching/)

Ensure browser is caching certain resources.

Has `maxage = 0`

Note the static resources are being served from the Express server, not from Nginx.

`config/middleware.express.js`

changed

```
app.use(express.static(path.resolve(__dirname, '../public')));
app.use('/assets', express.static(path.resolve(__dirname, '../public/assets')));
```

to

```
var options = {
	maxAge: '90d'
};
app.use(express.static(path.resolve(__dirname, '../public'), options));
app.use('/assets', express.static(path.resolve(__dirname, '../public/assets'), options));	
```

## Varvy SEO Tool

[Varvy SEO Tool](https://varvy.com/)

Enter each URL and test.

Clean up any issues found.

* If modified Since

Odd finding. `Postman` Get on `https://www.feediator.com` does indeed not return the `Last-Modified` property. Also shows there is no caching

`Cache-Control â†’public, max-age=0`

`Postman` Get on `https://www.feediator.com/assets/css/home/styles.css` returns the `Last-Modified` property.

`Postman` Get on `https://johnvincent.io` returns the `Last-Modified` property.

Express server would need to return the `last-modified` property, which assumes it knows. However, it realistically cannot know as the Html is not static.

Decided to leave it.


### Varvy Speed Tool

[Varvy Speed Tool](https://varvy.com/pagespeed/)

Enter each URL and test.

Clean up any issues found.

* JavaScript not minimized
	* `assets/js/home/home.js`

Minimal impact. Decided to leave it.



### Varvy Mobile Tool

[Varvy Mobile Tool](https://varvy.com/mobile/)

Enter each URL and test.

```
Mobile friendly: 100
Mobile Speed: 91
```

All tests passed.

<br/>

## HTML Validator

[W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/)

* Stray start tag head

`main.hbs` had the extra code. Removed it.

* `<nav .... role="navigation">`

Removed `role="navigation"`

*`<main role="main">`

Removed `role="main"`

* ` Bad value contentinfo for attribute role on element`

`home.hbs` had `<ul ... role="contentinfo"`

Removed `role="contentinfo"`

<br/>


## CSS Validator

[CSS Validator by W3C](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

* `alpha(opacity=85)` is an unknown vendor extension.

Problem is in `_header.scss`, calls a mixin `@include opacity(0.85);`.

The mixin

```
@mixin opacity($opacity) {
    opacity: $opacity;
    $opacity-ie: $opacity * 100;
    filter: alpha(opacity=$opacity-ie); //IE8
}
```

The trouble is `filter: alpha(opacity=$opacity-ie);`

Code is not helpful and so I removed it.

* `--cover-min-height: 100px}`

Removed the code.

#### Accessibility

Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.

Odd as same color and background colors are used for other text in the intro section.

Change font-weight from 300 to 400.

[Accessibility Engine](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/2.2/color-contrast?application=lighthouse) is a useful tool

Provides a color contrast analyzer. Used this to set the foreground color `#ffffff` to find a background color close to the original primary color `#1f8dd6` which passes the contrast test.

Settled on `#105B8E`

This fixed the problem.

#### Progressive Web App

Needs a service worker etc. 

This is not a Progressive Web App and so it doesn't need service workers.

No changes.
